# Video-Motion-Magnification
1. Firstly , you can create vibrating white circle and magnify its motion. If you want to upload any video by using videReadFunction().
2. After reading frames, spatial decomposition has done. Laplace image pyramids, generally decomposition depth is related to your image size of the video. 
3. Then, I used Split Spectrum Processing (SSP) to filter my pyramis images but you can use Band Pass Filter Section.
4. After filtering, reconstruction has done.
5. You can see the output on Result Section
